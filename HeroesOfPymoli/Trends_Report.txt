Report on Trends uncovered in the Player transaction data from the game world of Heroes of Pymoli

1) Gender representation:

It's clear to see that Male players outnumber Female / Other players by a large margin.  In particular, for this time period players identifying as "Other / Non-Disclosed" are a small slice of the population.

We see that female players on average spend more per transaction than male players.

Other / Non-Disclosed players spend more per transaction as well, but the number of transactions in this category is quite small so it would be too soon to feel confident in drawing the conclusion that they are the players who spend the most by gender identity.

2) Purchases per-person by age group:

The biggest per-person spending age brackets are the '< 10', '35 - 9' and '20 - 24' groups.

3) Most profitable age group:

The age block representing the most purchase value is by far the '20 - 24' group.  Average purchase price per individual is not as great as other groups, but total purchases aggregated shows this group as driving the largest block of commerce in the game world.
